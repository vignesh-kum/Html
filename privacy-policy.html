                        <h6>1.2. Personal Information Generated and/or Automatically Collected during your use of the Platform</h6>
                        <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Information about your device and its software:</strong> Information about your device and its software includes your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, device type/model/manufacturer,
                            operating system, date and time stamp, and a unique ID that allows us to identify your browser, mobile device, or your Account (including, for example, a persistent device identifier or an Ad ID), and other similar information.
                            We may also work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including statistical modeling tools, that permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices. We use this device and software information to diagnose
                            and fix technology problems, serve you personalized advertising, personalize your experience, perform analytics/identify usage trends, and improve our products and Services.</p>
                        <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Information about the way you access and use our Services:</strong> example, information about the way you access and use our Services includes the site from which you came and the site to which
                            you are going when you leave. In addition, we track the pages you visit on the Platform, the links you click on the Platform, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails that we send, other actions you take
                            on the Services, and whether you access the Services from multiple devices. We may also use the information about the way you access and use our Services to determine products and services that may be of interest to you, to
                            improve our products and Services, to evaluate the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, and to send you marketing communications.</p>
                        <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Analytics information:</strong> We may collect analytics data or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics to help us measure traffic and usage trends and the demographics of our
                            users in order to improve our Services. You can learn more about Google's practices at
                            <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners</a></p>
                        <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Location Information:</strong>In some cases, you provide your location information to us directly (e.g. when you provide us with a delivery address). In other cases, we may collect your location
                            through GPS, WiFi, wireless network triangulation or other methods, or we may otherwise infer your location based on other information we collect. (For example, we can approximate your location by your IP Address.) We use location
                            information to customize content on our Services (e.g., show you the Restaurants that will deliver to your location and show you relevant Perks), facilitate order and delivery Services, detect and prevent fraud, and measure
                            traffic and analytics on the Services. If you have previously opted into Bringmeal collection and use of location-based information through our mobile application, you may opt-out by adjusting the settings on your mobile device.
                            We also use the Google Maps API to gather information about your location. Google uses various technologies to determine your location, including IP address, GPS and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google with
                            information on nearby devices, WiFi access points and cell towers (see the Google privacy policy and the Google Maps terms of service to learn more).</p>

                        <p>We typically collect the foregoing information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology
                            (collectively, “tracking technologies”), and we may use third-party partners or services to assist with this effort. Information we collect automatically about you or your device may be combined with other personal information
                            we collect directly. For information about our and our third-party partners’ use of cookies and related technologies to collect information automatically, and choices you may have in relation to its collection, please see our
                            About Our Ads policy.</p>
                        <p>We, or the third-party partners we use, may use the data collected automatically through tracking technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the
                            Platform; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) identify and contact you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Services; (e) perform analytics and detect usage patterns
                            on our Services; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; (g) detect or prevent fraud or other harmful activities, and (h) otherwise plan for and enhance our Services and for other internal purposes.</p>
                        <h6>1.3. Data from other sources</h6>
                        <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Information we receive from third-party sites you connect to our Services:</strong> We may receive personal information about you from third parties and combine that with information we collect
                            through our Platform. For example, we may obtain information when you login through a third-party social network or authentication service, such as Facebook or Google. These services will authenticate your identity and provide
                            you the option to share certain personal information with us, which could include your name, email address, address book and contacts, or other information. Similarly, when you interact with us through a social media site or
                            third-party service, such as when you like, follow or share Bringmeal content on Facebook, Twitter, or other sites, we may receive information that you permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive
                            from these third-party sites is dependent upon that third party’s policies and your privacy settings on that third-party site.</p>
                        <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Information we receive from affiliates or third parties:</strong> From time to time, we may receive information about you from our Restaurant partners, in connection with our enterprise programs,
                            from other Bringmeal entities and affiliates, from co-marketing partners, service providers, and from other third parties. For example, if your company, university or organization participates in one of our enterprise programs,
                            we may receive your information from that participating organization for the purpose of setting up your Accounts or for billing purposes. We may receive additional information about you, such as fraud detection information,
                            from third party partners and combine it with other information that we have about you. We use this information from affiliates or third parties to create your Accounts, to contact you, to send you advertising or promotional
                            materials or to personalize our Services, to protect against bot attacks and account takeovers, and to better understand the demographics of our users.</p>
                        <p> We do not control, supervise or respond to how the third parties providing your information process your personal information, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed
                            to such third parties.</p>
