                        </h4>
                        <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">(a) Scope of Arbitration Agreement:</strong> You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Services as a consumer of our Services, to any advertising or
                            marketing communications regarding the Company or the Services, to any products or services sold or distributed through the Services that you received as a consumer of our Services, or to any aspect of your relationship or
                            transactions with Company as a consumer of our Services will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter
                            remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or the Company may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights
                            (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this
                            Agreement. CASES HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY—AND OTHERS MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE—THAT ATTEMPT TO ASSERT CLASS ACTION CLAIMS, AND BY ACCEPTING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT YOU ELECT NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH CASES.

                        <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">(c) Arbitrator Powers:</strong> The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability,
                            enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities,
                            if any, of you and the Company. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive
                            of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules,
                            and this Agreement (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award)
                            is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
                            The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and the Company.</p>

                        <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">(d) Waiver of Jury Trial:</strong> YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and the Company are instead electing
                            to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration, except as specified in section 12(a) above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.</p>

                        <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">(e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions:</strong> YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE
                            BASIS. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY
                            OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or dispute, neither you nor the Company
                            is entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute. Instead, all such claims and disputes will then be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 20.</p>

                        <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">(f) Opt Out:</strong> You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement If you do so, neither you nor the Company can force the other to arbitrate as a result of this Agreement. To opt out, you must
                            notify the Company in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Bringmeal username (if any), the email address you used to
                            set up your Bringmeal account (if you have one), and a CLEAR statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to: opt-out@Bringmeal.com. If you opt out of this Arbitration
                            Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may have entered into with us or may enter into
                            in the future with us. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SUPERSEDE, AMEND, OR MODIFY THE TERMS OF ANY SEPARATE AGREEMENT(S) BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY RELATING TO YOUR WORK AS
                            AN EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT GOVERNING YOUR SERVICES AS A Contractor. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, IF YOU ARE A Contractor, OPTING-OUT OF THE ARBITRATION
                            AGREEMENT SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 12 HAS NO AFFECT ON YOUR AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES COVERED BY YOUR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY.</p>

                        <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">(g) Survival:</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of your relationship with the Company.</p>

                        <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;">(h) Modification:</strong> Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if the Company makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will

                            upon delivery of alcohol products, you will provide valid government-issued identification proving your age to the Contractor delivering the alcohol products and that the recipient will not be intoxicated when receiving delivery
                            of such products. If you order alcohol products, you understand and acknowledge that neither Bringmeal nor the Contractor can accept your order of alcohol products, and the order will only be delivered if the Merchant accepts
                            your order. The Contractor reserves the right to refuse delivery if you are not 21 years of older, if you cannot provide a valid government issued ID, if the name on your ID does not match the name on your order, or you are
                            visibly intoxicated. If the Contractor is unable to complete the delivery of alcohol products for one or more of these reasons, you are subject to a non-refundable $20 re-stocking fee.</p>

                        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Bringmeal and its officers, directors, employees, agents and affiliates (each, an “Indemnified Party”), from and against any losses, claims, actions, costs, damages, penalties, fines and
                            expenses, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and expenses, that may be incurred by an Indemnified Party arising out of, relating to or resulting from (a) your User Content; (b) your misuse of the Software or Services;
                            (c) your breach of this Agreement or any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement; or (d) your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations through or related to the use of the Software or Services.
                            In the event of any claim, allegation, suit or proceeding alleging any matter potentially covered by the agreements in this section, you agree to pay for the defense of the Indemnified Party, including reasonable costs and
                            attorneys’ fees incurred by the Indemnified Party. Bringmeal reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will
                            fully cooperate with Bringmeal in asserting any available defenses. This provision does not require you to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any unconscionable commercial practice by such party, or for such party’s negligence,
                            fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Software or Services. You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination
